## Aspiring Data Scientist & Machine Learning Innovator | RRC Polytech Student

</div> 

I‚Äôm a passionate Data Science and Machine Learning student currently in my 3rd semester at RRC Polytech. I thrive on turning raw data into actionable insights and enjoy tackling complex challenges through innovative, data-driven solutions. My focus is on combining technical expertise with practical applications, whether it's developing machine learning models, analyzing trends, or building interactive dashboards.

I am continuously expanding my knowledge in areas like NLP, deep learning, and data architecture, and I love applying these skills to real-world problems. I aim to create meaningful impact through every project, bridging the gap between data and decision-making.


# üíª What I‚Äôm Working On

- Building Natural Language Processing (NLP) models like **CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs** in neural networks to enhance language understanding and processing.
- A chatbot for answering student questions related to RRC programs using **LLaMA** or Microsoft-based models.
- Creating a high-level block diagram and logical data model as part of Information and Data Architecture coursework.
- Building models to predict outcomes based on specific datasets, like species classification and other machine learning tasks.


# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, NoSQL
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Langchain
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Git, Jupyter Notebooks, Jupyter Lab, VS Code, Google Colab
- **Cloud Platforms**: Familiarity with AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for data storage and processing


# üå± What I‚Äôm Learning

- More advanced machine learning techniques and their ethical considerations.
- Building stronger communication and teamwork skills through collaborative projects.
- Deepening my knowledge of Power BI for data visualization and Git for version control.
